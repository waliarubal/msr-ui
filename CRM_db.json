    "Description": "Please make the connections, indicated in the attached diagram, between the Smart Jersey Brain board, the LED flexible display, and the Adafruit Powerboost module. \n\nPlease use elegoo cables or similar so the boards can be disconnected from each other. These header connections are indicated by the black rectangles over the wires in the diagram. Note the signals coming off the LED display board already have a female header attached to them, so you don’t have to solder connections to the LED display board; just attach male sided wires to the 5V & GND (from Powerboost), and DATA_IN (from Brain). \n\nI’ll also send a pico-lock connector, which can be plugged into J4 on the brain. This connector has four signals that need to come off the brain on it.  It may be easiest to cut this cable assembly in two and rework it to plug into the other wires, instead of soldering directly to the brain board. ",

I have double-checked and they are correctly labelled (I thought they might be in the wrong component bag), but it was probably just a mistake because their part numbers are so similar. Just something to watch out for the next build.\n\n•\tWe are running low on BM04B-SRSS-TB connectors (J22, J23, J24, J25, J26, J27), and have only 6 left (each board takes 6). Instead of fitting all on one board, can we make sure that J25 and J26 are fitted on both boards. J22, J23, J24, and J27 can be left as DNF.\n\n•\tPlease trim FAN1 leads as short as possible and solder red wire to [+] and black wire to [-].\n\n",

    "Description": "The team has expressed that they would like the default cockpit view to go back to having the dashboard view angle stationary, instead of panning with the rest of the views. Since the dashboard monitor moves with the 6DOF system, the position of the dashboard view on the monitor doesn't have to change. They would also like to set a default zoom position of the cockpit to be like the photo provided in the teams thread (fun fact- this was based on feedback from a pilot who has flown that aircraft in real life! :P ). They've also noted that the monitors change sometimes when the simulation restarts. This may be because they are running their own scenario? Can you provide instructions as to how to make the monitors show up the same way each time? I know we talked before about how if the system restarts, the monitor order needs to be reset... but if we can't change that, can we make sure they show up the same between simulations?",

Before doing so, let's also mark any important buttons for the set-up process with colored stickers (I will provide) [He will put these stickers in the simulator room tomorrow]. Once finished, the photographs should be marked up/annotated with arrows and text to clarify which cable goes to what, etc.\n\n\n\nThe instructions provided on Page 8 look great, but I think we should also make demo videos that show the process as well. One of the \"Start-Up\" section and one of the \"Switch to VR Mode.\"\n\n\n\nI would also like Michael to change the color-coding of the cable-lines on the \"Video System\" figure. These colors should be different from those used in the \"Audio System\" figure, and should be colored not based upon type of cable, but rather the function (e.g. VR Mode, Varjo, Experimenter Computer, Data Recording), etc.\n\n\n\nI very much appreciate the work that Michael has done so far in documenting the system. I hope he would be willing to add these final touches which will help someone like me better understand how everything works together.\"",

Teresa has offered to do the design for the logos, so just hand her the design as soon as possible to coordinate that. Ideally, I’d like the case with the logo in hand by 7/29, in time for a demo, but let me know if that’s not possible.\n\nUpdate (7/23 @ 4:45pm):\nCustomer has made requests in more detail about the cases. He has requested two cases, described below:\nCase 1:\n-\tHalf black, half white case. The black side has a white Windows logo, and the white side has a black “MSR” \nCase 2:\n-\tHalf black, half white case. The black side has a white Puma logo, and the white side has a black “MSR”",
